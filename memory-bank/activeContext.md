# Active Context - FinRL Development

## Current Task: CryptoFutures Environment Implementation

**Task ID**: DEV-001  
**Type**: Feature Development  
**Complexity Level**: Level 3 (Intermediate Feature)  
**Current Phase**: IMPLEMENT  
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

## Task Overview

We're implementing a cryptocurrency futures trading environment by extending the existing `CryptoEnv` class from FinRL. This environment will support futures trading mechanics including funding rates, leverage, slippage, and proper risk management.

## Implementation Plan

We have developed a comprehensive plan for implementing the cryptocurrency futures trading environment:

### 1. Environment Setup and Base Class Extension

- Copy the existing `CryptoEnv` class from `finrl/meta/env_cryptocurrency_trading/crypto_env.py`
- Create a subclass `CryptoFuturesEnv` that extends `CryptoEnv` in the same file
- Add futures-specific parameters to the constructor
- Register the environment with Gym

### 2. Funding Rate Integration

- Implement Binance API downloader for historical funding rates
- Add funding rate storage in the environment state
- Incorporate funding rates into the reward calculation

### 3. Slippage and Trading Mechanics

- Implement realistic slippage model based on order size
- Modify step() method to account for slippage in price execution
- Add leverage parameter and margin requirements
- Implement liquidation checks during position management

### 4. Observation and Action Space

- Extend observation space to include funding rate information
- Implement position size normalization for observations
- Create action masking to prevent invalid trades
- Add utility methods for observation transformation

### 5. RLlib Integration

- Create Gym registration for the new environment
- Implement RLlib configuration for SAC with the new environment
- Add transformer network option for attention-based policy

### 6. Testing and Validation

- Implement unit tests for environment initialization
- Create tests for step() functionality with funding rates
- Test slippage calculations under various conditions
- Validate RLlib integration and training

## Creative Phase Results

During the creative phase, we designed and documented the following components:

### 1. Slippage Model

Selected a hybrid approach with a non-linear model that can use order book data when available.

### 2. Funding Rate Implementation

Designed a hybrid approach that tracks accrued funding separately while modeling discrete funding events, balancing realism with learning stability.

### 3. Observation Space Design

Created an extended observation space design that maintains compatibility with the base environment while adding futures-specific features.

### 4. Risk Management Component

Developed a robust system for tracking liquidation prices, entry prices, and enforcing margin requirements.

## Next Steps

We are now ready to begin implementation, starting with:

1. Setting up the base environment structure
2. Implementing the core components following our creative phase designs
3. Integrating with RLlib and developing the testing framework

## Project Context

This task is part of extending FinRL's capabilities to support more advanced trading strategies. The cryptocurrency futures trading environment will allow reinforcement learning agents to learn and execute strategies that take advantage of funding rates, leverage, and proper risk management in cryptocurrency futures markets.

## Technical Notes

- The existing `CryptoEnv` in `finrl/meta/env_cryptocurrency_trading/env_multiple_crypto.py` will be our starting point
- We'll need to create a more realistic trading model that accounts for slippage and funding rates
- Integration with RLlib will be crucial for training with attention-based networks
