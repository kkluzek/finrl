# Active Context: FinRL Project

## Current Focus

**Initialization Phase** - Setting up Memory Bank system for project management and task tracking.

## Immediate Context

- **Project Type**: Existing Python library for financial reinforcement learning
- **Current Status**: Established codebase with comprehensive structure
- **Architecture**: Multi-module Python package with DRL agents and financial environments

## Active Areas

1. **Core Library**: `finrl/` directory contains main modules
2. **Examples**: Practical implementations and tutorials
3. **Testing**: Unit tests for validation
4. **Documentation**: User guides and API documentation

## Development Environment

- **Python Environment**: Conda environment detected
- **Build System**: Poetry (pyproject.toml) and setuptools (setup.py)
- **Version Control**: Git repository with GitHub integration
- **CI/CD**: Pre-commit hooks configured

## Next Steps

- Determine specific task or enhancement needed
- Assess complexity level for appropriate workflow
- Establish task tracking in tasks.md

## Notes

- Comprehensive financial RL library with multiple DRL algorithms
- Supports various financial environments (stocks, crypto, portfolio optimization)
- Active development with established community
