# Project Progress Tracker

## Current Task: CryptoFutures Environment Implementation (DEV-001)

**Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS  
**Current Phase**: CREATIVE ✅ COMPLETED, moving to IMPLEMENT

### Progress Updates

#### May 2025

- ✅ **[2025-05-XX]** Initialized Memory Bank system (INIT-001)
- ✅ **[2025-05-XX]** Completed planning phase for CryptoFutures Environment (DEV-001)
  - Created comprehensive implementation plan
  - Identified key components requiring creative design
  - Mapped out implementation strategy and dependencies
- ✅ **[2025-05-XX]** Completed creative phase for CryptoFutures Environment
  - Designed slippage model with multiple options, selected hybrid approach
  - Created funding rate implementation approach with hybrid tracking
  - Designed observation space structure for futures-specific features
  - Developed risk management system with liquidation price tracking

### Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of base environment structure
2. Implement core components following the creative phase designs:
   - Set up CryptoFuturesEnv class extending CryptoEnv
   - Implement the slippage model using the hybrid approach
   - Add funding rate tracking and application
   - Extend observation space with futures-specific features
   - Implement risk management with liquidation price tracking
3. Integrate with RLlib and develop testing framework

## Task Completion History

1. **INIT-001**: Memory Bank Initialization ✅ COMPLETED
   - Set up Memory Bank directory structure
   - Created all required files
   - Documented project context and technical foundation

## Open Issues

- Need to determine appropriate default values for parameters like base slippage and leverage
- Consider how to efficiently test liquidation mechanics without waiting for rare events
- Plan for backtesting infrastructure to validate trading strategies
