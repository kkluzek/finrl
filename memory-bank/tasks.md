## Current Task: CryptoFutures Environment Implementation

**Task ID**: DEV-001  
**Type**: Feature Development  
**Status**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS  
**Complexity Level**: Level 3 (Intermediate Feature)

### Task Description

Implement a cryptocurrency futures trading environment by extending the existing `CryptoEnv` class from FinRL. This environment will support futures trading mechanics including funding rates, leverage, slippage, and proper risk management.

### Progress Checklist

- [ ] Environment Setup and Base Class Extension
  - [ ] Copy the existing `CryptoEnv` class from `finrl/meta/env_cryptocurrency_trading/crypto_env.py`
  - [ ] Create a subclass `CryptoFuturesEnv` that extends `CryptoEnv` in the same file
  - [ ] Add futures-specific parameters to the constructor
  - [ ] Register the environment with Gym
- [ ] Funding Rate Integration
  - [ ] Implement Binance API downloader for historical funding rates
  - [ ] Add funding rate storage in the environment state
  - [ ] Incorporate funding rates into the reward calculation
- [ ] Slippage and Trading Mechanics
  - [ ] Implement realistic slippage model based on order size
  - [ ] Modify step() method to account for slippage in price execution
  - [ ] Add leverage parameter and margin requirements
  - [ ] Implement liquidation checks during position management
- [ ] Observation and Action Space
  - [ ] Extend observation space to include funding rate information
  - [ ] Implement position size normalization for observations
  - [ ] Create action masking to prevent invalid trades
  - [ ] Add utility methods for observation transformation
- [ ] RLlib Integration
  - [ ] Create Gym registration for the new environment
  - [ ] Implement RLlib configuration for SAC with the new environment
  - [ ] Add transformer network option for attention-based policy
- [ ] Testing and Validation
  - [ ] Implement unit tests for environment initialization
  - [ ] Create tests for step() functionality with funding rates
  - [ ] Test slippage calculations under various conditions
  - [ ] Validate RLlib integration and training

### Components List

1. **Base Environment** üîÑ IN PROGRESS
   - Extending `CryptoEnv` class to support futures trading
   - Adding futures-specific parameters and state variables

2. **Funding Rate System** ‚úÖ DESIGNED
   - API integration for historical funding rates
   - Funding rate application to positions using hybrid approach
   - Tracking of accrued and realized funding

3. **Slippage Model** ‚úÖ DESIGNED
   - Non-linear slippage model with order book integration option
   - Scale-based implementation for computational efficiency

4. **Risk Management** ‚úÖ DESIGNED
   - Leverage handling with configurable parameters
   - Liquidation price tracking and calculation
   - Position entry price tracking

5. **Observation Space** ‚úÖ DESIGNED
   - Extended flat vector observation with futures-specific features
   - Compatibility with existing RL algorithms

6. **RLlib Integration** üìã PLANNED
   - Environment registration
   - SAC configuration
   - Transformer network support

### Implementation Strategy

The implementation will follow these phases:

1. **Base Environment Setup**: First, we'll extend the existing environment, focusing on maintaining compatibility with the original API.

2. **Futures Mechanics**: We'll then add the specific mechanics of futures trading (funding rates, leverage, liquidation).

3. **Integration & Testing**: Finally, we'll ensure proper integration with RLlib and thorough testing.

### Dependencies and Integration Points

- The environment depends on `finrl.meta.env_cryptocurrency_trading.crypto_env.py`
- Integration with RLlib through the agent wrappers in `finrl.agents.rllib`
- Potential need for data processors from `finrl.meta.data_processors`

### Potential Challenges and Mitigations

1. **Challenge**: Correctly modeling funding rate impact on positions
   **Mitigation**: Start with simplified model, then refine based on backtesting

2. **Challenge**: Ensuring realistic slippage without oversimplification
   **Mitigation**: Implement multiple slippage models for comparison

3. **Challenge**: Maintaining proper Gym API compatibility
   **Mitigation**: Thoroughly test with latest Gym versions and RLlib

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Environment successfully handles futures trading mechanics including funding rates
- [ ] Slippage model realistically affects trade execution
- [ ] Risk management properly enforces margin requirements and liquidation
- [ ] Environment is compatible with RLlib and can be used for training
- [ ] All unit tests pass and validate functionality

### Creative Phase Completion

The creative phase for this task is now complete. We have designed the following components:

1. **Slippage Model**: A hybrid approach that balances realism with computational efficiency
2. **Funding Rate Implementation**: A system that tracks accrued funding while modeling discrete events
3. **Observation Space Design**: A compatible extension of the base observation space with futures-specific features
4. **Risk Management Component**: A robust system for tracking liquidation prices and enforcing margin requirements

These designs are documented in `memory-bank/creative/creative-cryptofutures.md` and will guide the implementation phase.

## Which FinRL pieces to reuse?

## Small-step TDD task list (patched paths)

The table shows only the tasks whose **paths / imports changed**; all other atomic tasks from the previous English

Everything else (CI setup, metrics, callback, report, etc.) is identical to the earlier checklist.

## Quick sanity-check script (optional)

```python
from finrl.meta.env_cryptocurrency_trading.crypto_env import CryptoEnv
env = CryptoEnv({"df": your_dataframe})
print(env.observation_space, env.action_space)
```

If that runs inside the Conda env, the **paths above are correct**.
The same import is used widely in FinRL-Tutorials notebooks.([GitHub][4])

---

## Why this change was needed

1. **FinRL-Meta split** ‚Äì all crypto environments were merged back into the
   main FinRL repo after v0.4.3 to reduce installation friction.([GitHub][2])
2. File was renamed from `env_multiple_crypto.py` to `crypto_env.py`
   to match the single-file pattern used by the stock & portfolio envs
   (see commit discussion #83).([GitHub][3])
3. The FinRL README now advertises the three sub-folders explicitly,
   so the safest import base is `finrl.meta.env_cryptocurrency_trading`.([GitHub][1])
