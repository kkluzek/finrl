# Project Brief: FinRL - Financial Reinforcement Learning

## Project Overview

FinRL is a comprehensive Python library for applying Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to quantitative finance and algorithmic trading. The project provides a standardized environment for financial market simulation and automated trading strategy development.

## Technical Foundation

- **Language**: Python
- **Core Framework**: Reinforcement Learning with financial market environments
- **Key Libraries**: OpenAI Gym, Stable Baselines 3, ElegantRL
- **Data Sources**: Yahoo Finance, Alpaca, CCXT for cryptocurrency
- **Dependencies**: NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch/TensorFlow

## Architecture

- **Agents**: Various DRL algorithms (A2C, PPO, SAC, TD3, TRPO)
- **Environments**: Stock trading, portfolio optimization, cryptocurrency trading
- **Data Processing**: Market data preprocessing and feature engineering
- **Evaluation**: Backtesting with Pyfolio integration

## Project Structure

- `finrl/`: Core library modules
- `examples/`: Demo implementations and tutorials
- `docs/`: Documentation and guides
- `unit_tests/`: Test suite
